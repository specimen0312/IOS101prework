App Idea: "Daily Impact" - A Personal Growth Tracker
Description:
Daily Impact is a personal growth app that helps users cultivate habits, set daily goals, and reflect on their impact each day. The app combines habit tracking with journaling, providing a space to visualize progress and reflect on meaningful activities. It encourages users to build positive routines while also tracking their mood and daily gratitude.

Features:

Habit Tracker: A calendar-style tracker to set and monitor habits, with streak tracking and reminders.
Daily Reflection: A simple journaling tool with prompts to reflect on the day and identify areas for growth or gratitude.
Impact Dashboard: A visual summary of daily habits, mood, and reflections to show progress and patterns over time.
Social Component: An optional community feature to share achievements, tips, and encouragement with friends.
Gamification: Badges and rewards for completing streaks or achieving specific milestones.
This app could help individuals improve themselves by combining habit-forming principles with mindfulness and self-reflection.


## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Unused or Unconnected @IBOutlet
Challenge:
The @IBOutlet for the button (changeBackgroundColor) was declared but not used in the initial code.
If not connected to a storyboard element, this would cause the app to crash with an NSUnknownKeyException.
Solution:
Connect the @IBOutlet to the button in the storyboard or remove it if not needed.
Use it to add interactivity, such as attaching a target-action for user events.
